# Extinction maps and empirical isochrones
### This repo is intended to provide E(B-V) reddening calculations using the Stilism extinction maps from Lallement et al. 2019
### Future work will incorporate the recently updated 2022 maps.

### We also have the Jupyter notebook and input data for the empirical isochrones which are used to derive the age limits of the 4MOST sample.
